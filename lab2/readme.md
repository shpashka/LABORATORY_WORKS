A brief introduction to Linux

The task was to make an interesting Bash script.
I decided to make one which renames all the .jpeg photos in the directory of script into their dates of creation.
I had a lot of photos from my phone's camera and they had names unconvenient for me to find(when I connected phone to computer, I'd like to see the day when I made this photo so I could remember what I was doing in the exact day fastly)
