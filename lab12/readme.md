Now we need to operate with digits of a number not using arrays and strings - arrays of char
We aim to get a BCD-binary coded decimal from a decimal number. 
But due to the array and strings prohibition there are two main questions:
-how to get digits from left to right
-how to format binary digits with zeros

In fact, I had to do another task. For every two digits standing nearby I have to print the sum of them after these two digits(if it is a digit either).
